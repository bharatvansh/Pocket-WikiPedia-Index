        description: "Tinted Glass is a unique decorative block that allows players to see through it while completely blocking light from passing through. Unlike regular or stained glass, tinted glass drops itself as an item when broken without needing the Silk Touch enchantment. This makes it highly versatile for builds requiring specific lighting conditions, such as mob farms, where players want to observe mobs without letting light inside. It is crafted by surrounding a single glass block with four amethyst shards. It cannot be crafted into glass panes."

        description: "Glass is a fundamental transparent building block crafted by smelting sand in a furnace. It serves as a versatile construction material that allows light to pass through while providing weather protection. Glass is essential for building greenhouses, windows, modern architecture, and underwater structures. While fragile with low hardness and blast resistance (0.3 each), glass can be crafted into glass panes for more efficient space usage and lighter visual weight. Glass blocks are non-flammable and provide complete visibility from both sides. They're perfect for creating bright, airy interiors and are especially valuable for farming setups, aquariums, and decorative lighting effects. In Bedrock Edition, glass drops itself when broken, making collection straightforward without the need for Silk Touch enchantment."

        },
        description: "White Stained Glass is a transparent block created by surrounding a piece of White Dye with eight glass blocks. It retains the transparency of regular glass while adding a soft white tint, perfect for modern windows or decorative light filters. Like regular glass, it is fragile and requires a Silk Touch tool to be harvested; otherwise, it shatters when broken."

        },
        description: "Glass Panes are thin, transparent blocks that serve as a more resource-efficient alternative to full glass blocks for windows. One crafting recipe yields 16 panes from 6 glass blocks. They automatically connect to adjacent solid blocks and other panes, forming a seamless glass surface. While they share the fragile 0.3 hardness of glass blocks, they offer more architectural detail and depth to builds. Like regular glass, they shatter when broken and require a tool with Silk Touch to be harvested as an item."
