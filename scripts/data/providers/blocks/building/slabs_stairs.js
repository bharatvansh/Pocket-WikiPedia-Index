        description: "Polished Tuff Stairs are the stair-shaped variant of polished tuff, introduced in Minecraft 1.21 as part of the Trial Chambers block palette. They are primarily used to create smooth staircases, sloped roofs, and detailed edging while keeping the same dark gray tone as other tuff variants. Polished tuff stairs can be crafted from polished tuff in the standard stair recipe or obtained more efficiently by stonecutting a polished tuff block. They also generate naturally in Trial Chambers, where they appear alongside other tuff and copper blocks in hallways and room details."

        description: "Tuff Slabs are the half-block variant of tuff introduced in version 1.21. They provide a low-profile alternative for detailed flooring, ceilings, and architecture while keeping tuff's distinctive dark gray texture. Slabs are crafted by placing three tuff blocks horizontally in a crafting grid or by using a stonecutter. They generate naturally within Trial Chambers, often forming part of the corridors' floors and ceilings. Like other slabs, they can be placed in the top or bottom half of a block space or combined into a double slab, allowing for smooth architectural transitions."

Slabs are crafted from polished tuff blocks or produced efficiently via a stonecutter. They generate naturally in Trial Chambers as decorative flooring and ceiling accents. These blocks are valuable for creating seamless transitions, detailed trim, and intricate patterns that require both the polished aesthetic and the utility of half-blocks."
