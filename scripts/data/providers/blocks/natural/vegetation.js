        description: "Pale Hanging Moss is a gray vegetation block that grows beneath Pale Oak Leaves in the Pale Garden biome, introduced in Minecraft 1.21.50. It forms eerie, hanging tendrils that contribute to the biome's haunting atmosphere and emit unique ambient sounds. Players can collect it using shears, but it cannot be crafted. This moss is a signature feature of the Pale Garden, the home of the Creaking mob, and provides a distinct visual style compared to other moss types. It must be obtained directly from its natural habitat."

        description: "The Pale Moss Block is a grayish moss variant native to the Pale Garden biome. It spreads onto stone and deepslate when fertilized with bone meal, converting surfaces into pale moss. While breakable by hand, hoes are the most efficient tools for mining. This block facilitates the natural generation of Pale Hanging Moss and Eyeblossoms, making it vital for biome-specific flora. With its desaturated tone, it is a popular decorative choice for creating eerie, muted, or aged landscapes in Minecraft."

        description: "Pale Moss Carpet is a decorative vegetation block that naturally covers the ground in the Pale Garden biome, introduced in version 1.21.50. Similar to green moss carpet, it provides a thin, textured layer for floors and landscapes without filling a full block. It can be crafted from Pale Moss Blocks or generated by using bone meal on a Pale Moss Block. Its distinct pale gray color contributes to the ghostly, desaturated atmosphere of its native environment, making it an excellent choice for builders creating eerie, monochromatic, or foggy landscapes."
