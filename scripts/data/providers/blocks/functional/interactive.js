Unlike regular monster spawners, trial spawners activate when a player enters a 14-block radius and spawn mobs based on the number of nearby players. All spawned mobs must be defeated before the trial spawner ejects loot and a trial key. Ominous variants appear during ominous events and spawn stronger, armored mobs."

When unlocked using a trial key obtained from defeating all mobs spawned by a nearby trial spawner, the vault ejects 3-6 items including valuable loot like armor trims, banner patterns, enchanted books, and the heavy core. Vaults emit a bright light when active or ejecting items, and cannot be accelerated by any tool."
