Unlike regular monster spawners, trial spawners activate when a player enters a 14-block radius and spawn mobs based on the number of nearby players. All spawned mobs must be defeated before the trial spawner ejects loot and a trial key. Ominous variants appear during ominous events and spawn stronger, armored mobs. As a permanent structure block, it cannot be obtained by players."

When unlocked using a trial key obtained from defeating all mobs spawned by a nearby trial spawner, the vault ejects 3-6 items including valuable loot like armor trims, banner patterns, enchanted books, and the heavy core.

To activate, it must be surrounded by a frame of 16-42 prismarine blocks (or variants) and be submerged in water. When active, it emits light level 15, attacks hostile mobs within range, and provides players with water breathing, night vision, and Haste underwater within a 32-96 block radius depending on frame size. Crafted from 8 Nautilus Shells and 1 Heart of the Sea, conduits are essential for underwater bases and ocean monument exploration."

It significantly reduces movement speed and jump height for entities walking on it, and prevents fall damage entirely. Its most notable feature is its stickiness; entities walking or falling against its side will slide down slowly. In redstone contraptions, honey blocks stick to most adjacent blocks when moved by pistons, but crucially, they do not stick to slime blocks, allowing for more compact and complex machinery."

When placed next to water, it instantly absorbs all water source blocks and flowing water within a 7-block taxicab distance, up to a maximum of 65 blocks, and becomes a Wet Sponge. This makes it an essential tool for clearing out underwater structures or draining ponds. Once wet, it can no longer absorb water until it is dried by smelting it in a furnace or placing it in the Nether, where it instantly evaporates its stored water."

        description: "A Bell is an interactive functional block found primarily in village meeting points. It can be rung by players using the interact button or by being hit with projectiles, producing a loud ringing sound and a swaying animation. In Bedrock Edition, ringing a bell during a raid highlights nearby raiders with the Glowing effect, making them visible through walls. It also serves as a gathering point for villagers, who congregate around it during certain times of the day or when it is rung. Bells can be attached to the side, top, or bottom of solid blocks."

        description: "Scaffolding is a functional block used to assist players when building structures. It allows players to quickly climb up or down by jumping or crouching while inside the block. Scaffolding can be stacked up to 6 blocks horizontally from a supported base before it falls due to gravity. One of its most useful features is the ability to break the bottom-most block, causing the entire stack to collapse and drop as items. This makes it a superior alternative to temporary dirt or gravel pillars during large-scale construction projects."

        description: "A Jukebox is an interactive block that plays music discs when one is inserted by right-clicking or through hoppers and droppers. While playing, it emits note particles and a redstone signal that can power adjacent redstone components. The hardness was increased from 0.8 to 2.0 and blast resistance from 0.8 to 6.0 in update 1.20.30. Tamed parrots and allays within a 3-block radius dance when music is playing. Jukeboxes are essential for ambiance and can be used in redstone contraptions, making them both decorative and functional in Bedrock Edition."
