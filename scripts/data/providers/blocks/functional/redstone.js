        description: "The Lightning Rod is a functional block that attracts lightning strikes within a 128-block radius, protecting flammable structures from fire damage. When struck by lightning, it emits a redstone signal for 8 game ticks and creates a particle effect visible to all players. Crafted from three copper ingots, the lightning rod oxidizes over time but can be waxed with honeycomb to preserve its appearance. It provides excellent protection for wooden builds and can be used to harness lightning for redstone contraptions."

It can be attached to floors, walls, ceilings, and some upside-down slabs or stairs, making it easy to integrate into builds. In Bedrock Edition, levers are waterloggable, break quickly, and can generate in jungle temples, woodland mansions, and ancient cities."

        },
        description: "The Observer is a redstone block that emits a short redstone pulse when it detects a state change in the block directly in front of its sensor face. It features two distinct sides: a square sensor face that monitors adjacent blocks and a redstone output on the opposite side. Observers can detect a wide variety of changes, including block placement, breaking, growth stages of crops, and even the opening of chests. They are fundamental in creating advanced redstone automation and compact logic circuits, especially in Bedrock Edition where they have unique interaction behaviors."
