        description: "The Wind Charge is a versatile projectile item dropped by Breezes in Trial Chambers or crafted from Breeze Rods. When thrown, it travels in a straight line and explodes upon impact, creating a wind burst that knocks back entities and can interact with redstone components. Players often use Wind Charges for 'wind jumping,' allowing them to reach high places while safely negating any fall damage from the boost. In Bedrock Edition, the Wind Charge has a short half-second cooldown, making it a dynamic tool for both combat and traversal."
