        description: "The Netherite Helmet represents the pinnacle of head protection in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. It is crafted by upgrading a Diamond Helmet at a Smithing Table using a Netherite Ingot and a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template. Beyond its formidable 3 armor points and 3 armor toughness, it provides unique knockback resistance. Its most distinctive feature is its immunity to fire; if a player dies in lava, the helmet will float on the surface instead of being destroyed, allowing for potential recovery."
