Breezes drop breeze rods, a key material for Trial Chambers-related progression and crafting."

        description: "Guardians are aquatic hostile mobs that spawn exclusively in and around ocean monuments, serving as the primary defenders of these underwater structures. They are formidable opponents with two distinct attack modes: a slow-charging laser beam that deals significant damage (ranging from 4 to 9 points depending on difficulty) and defensive spikes that automatically retaliate against melee attackers. Guardians swim in abrupt, jerky charges when active, with their spikes retracted, and extend their spikes while idle or on land. Their distinctive eye tracks any nearby players constantly, making their targeting behavior apparent. Unlike most aquatic mobs, guardians do not suffocate out of water, though they become vulnerable and erratic on land, hopping helplessly while still able to use their laser attack. Guardians are valuable farming targets as they drop prismarine shards, prismarine crystals, and various types of fish. Their drops include rare fish variants like pufferfish and tropical fish when killed by players. The prismarine materials they drop are essential for crafting prismarine blocks, sea lanterns, and conduits. Guardians' laser attacks are unique in that they are affected by the Strength potion, despite being a ranged attack. When exploring ocean monuments, guardians present a significant challenge due to their numbers, damaging lasers, and defensive spikes, requiring careful preparation including appropriate armor, weapons, and possibly water breathing potions."

        description: "Wither Skeletons are dangerous undead hostile mobs found exclusively in Nether Fortresses. They are taller and darker variants of regular skeletons, standing 2.4 blocks high and wielding stone swords instead of bows. Their most distinctive and dangerous feature is their ability to inflict the Wither status effect on any target they hit, which turns the health bar black and deals 1 HP of damage every 2 seconds for 10 seconds. Unlike the Poison effect, Wither can kill players and mobs, making Wither Skeletons particularly lethal even with their relatively modest base damage of 9 HP on Normal difficulty. They are immune to fire and lava, allowing them to navigate the Nether's hazardous terrain safely. Wither Skeletons sprint toward their targets when aggravated and attack players, iron golems, snow golems, baby turtles, piglins, and piglin brutes. They flee from wolves but will fight back if cornered. These mobs are crucial for progression to late-game content, as they have a rare 2.5% chance to drop Wither Skeleton Skulls, which can be increased to 8.5% with Looting III enchantment. Three of these skulls are required to summon the Wither boss, one of Minecraft's most challenging fights. Their other drops include coal and bones, making them useful for resource farming. When brought to the Overworld, Wither Skeletons seek shade or water during daylight hours, though they do not burn in sunlight like regular skeletons."
