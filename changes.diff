It is obtained by smelting White Terracotta in a furnace. In Bedrock Edition, it generates naturally in underwater ruins and trail ruins. Unlike standard terracotta, it has a glossy finish and cannot be pushed by sticky pistons (they don't stick to it), making it useful for redstone machinery. It requires a pickaxe to mine and serves as a distinct, patterned building material."
