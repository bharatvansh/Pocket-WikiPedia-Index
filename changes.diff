As one of the most widely used materials, they are essential for crafting tools, crafting tables, chests, and sticks. They have a hardness of 2.0 and blast resistance of 3.0, making them suitable for basic shelter. Oak planks are flammable and can be used as fuel. They are the base material for oak stairs, slabs, fences, and doors."
