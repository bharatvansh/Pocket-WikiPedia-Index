It represents a withered shrub and provides an atmospheric touch to dry environments. When broken by hand or with most tools, it has a chance to drop 0-2 Sticks, serving as an emergency source of wood in treeless areas. To collect the Dead Bush itself for decoration (e.g., in flower pots), players must use Shears."

They are often used to create paths over water or in decorative ponds."
