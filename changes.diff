They provide a 1.5-block high collision box for entities, preventing most mobs from jumping over them while only occupying a single block space visually. They are ideal for creating ancient ruins, castle fortifications, or garden boundaries in lush environments. Naturally found in Strongholds in Bedrock Edition, they can also be crafted by combining Mossy Stone Bricks or using a stonecutter. They are fireproof and highly resistant to explosions."
